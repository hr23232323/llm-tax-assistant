1 A person can’t qualify more than one taxpayer to use the head of household filing status for the year.
2 The term “qualifying child” is defined in chapter 3. Note: If you are a noncustodial parent, the term “qualifying child” for head of household filing status doesn't include a child who is your
qualifying child only because of the rules described under Children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) under Qualifying Child in chapter 3. If you are the
custodial parent and those rules apply, the child is generally your qualifying child for head of household filing status even though the child isn't a qualifying child you can claim as a
dependent.
3 This person is a qualifying person if the only reason you can’t claim the person as a dependent is that you, or your spouse if filing jointly, can be claimed as a dependent on another
taxpayer’s return.
4 The term “qualifying relative” is defined in chapter 3.
5 If you can claim a person as a dependent only because of a multiple support agreement, that person isn't a qualifying person. See Multiple Support Agreement in chapter 3.

Table 3-1. Overview of the Rules for Claiming a Dependent
Caution. This table is only an overview of the rules. For details, see the rest of this chapter.
• You can’t claim any dependents if you (or your spouse if filing jointly) could be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer,
unless that taxpayer files a return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.
• You can’t claim a married person who files a joint return as a dependent unless that joint return is filed only to claim a refund of
withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.
• You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident alien, U.S. national, or a resident of
Canada or Mexico.1
• You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is your qualifying child or qualifying relative.

5. The child must not be filing a joint return for the year (unless
that joint return is filed only to get a refund of income tax

qualifying child. See Qualifying Child of More Than One Person,
later, to find out which person is the person entitled to claim the
child as a qualifying child.

•$10,000 if married filing separately and you lived with your
spouse at any time during the year, or
•$165,000 for all others .................................................... 11.
Is the amount on line 10 more than the amount on line 11?
If yes, then see the Note below.
If no, then the amount on line 10 is your modified AGI for Roth IRA purposes.
Note: If the amount on line 10 is more than the amount on line 11 and you have other income or loss items, such as social
security income or passive activity losses, that are subject to AGI-based phaseouts, you can refigure your AGI solely for the
purpose of figuring your modified AGI for Roth IRA purposes. (If you receive social security benefits, use Worksheet 1 in
Appendix B of Pub. 590-A to refigure your AGI.) Then, go to line 3 above in this Worksheet 9-2 to refigure your modified AGI. If
you don't have other income or loss items subject to AGI-based phaseouts, your modified AGI for Roth IRA purposes is the
amount on line 10.
